# Pattern-Mining


Description:

Setting up Python bindings for SPMF along with a comprehensive/robust platform to manange data more easily. Starting out with some of the more relevant algorithms needed to build and scrutinze recommendation use cases but will extend further to include others as they become more relevant to PPC's needs.

At the moment FP-Growth and FP-Growth Association Rules classes are established and fully functional.


Requirements:

  - Python 3.5+
  - SPMF jar needs to be available to the script. That can be found here:
